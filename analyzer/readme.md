# Analyzer
The analyzer script can automate the extraction of useful information about 
Subjects (Defects4J project, related with an ID).

The supported subjects are Cli32, Gson15 and Lang53, and either buggy and fixed
version are supported.

## Usage
The usage is `python3 analyzer.py <subject> <version> <action>`.

The tool must be runned in a folder containing the desired checkout subject with 
the name format `<subject_name><version>`.
The name must be one of `cli32`, `gson15` and `lang53`, while the version must be
provided as the initial (so must be either `b` or `f`).

An example folder name of a checkout defects4j project is `cli32b`.

An error is raised if this folder isn't found inside cwd.

## Actions
### Coverage
This action will launch `defects4j coverage` against the student test suites related
to a single (or every) tool, obtaining the cobertura's coverage xmls about line and
branch coverage of the test suite provided.

### Mutants
This action will launch specified tools against a dummy test suite, containing only
an empty test function. This serves in reporting all the mutants generated by the tool,
as Judy and Jumble won't report killed mutants status (while Major and Pit will).

PS: Judy won't generate any mutant with this method.
